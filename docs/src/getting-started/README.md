# Getting Started

The Pinger binary is all you need to create your own status page.

## Installing

Here are several ways you can install Pinger.

### Downloading the binary

You can download the binary from our
[Github releases](https://github.com/sdslabs/pinger/releases). Everything
is packaged inside the binary, including, the frontend.

<!-- TODO(vrongmeal): Add curl request to download after a release -->

### Docker

You can directly use the docker image to run Pinger. Use the docker image
hosted on
[Github packages](https://github.com/orgs/sdslabs/packages?ecosystem=docker&repo_name=pinger).

<!-- TODO(vrongmeal): Add command to run a container after a release -->

### Building from source

You can head over to the [contribution section](../contributing/index.html)
of this documentation to see how to build the project from scratch.
