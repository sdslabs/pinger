# Getting Started

The Pinger binary is all you need to create your own status page. As we are
still actively working on development of the project, you will need to build
the project from its [source code](https://github.com/sdslabs/pinger).

You can head over to the [contribution section](../contributing/index.html) of
this documentation to see how to build the project from scratch.
