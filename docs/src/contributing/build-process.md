# Build Process

We won't be running `make all` everytime. Since the command builds all the
components, it would take longer than usual when changing a couple lines in
one part of the code.

Currently we need to build three things:

1. Binary
1. Docker Image
1. Documentation

Let's take a look at both of them individually.

## Binary

The binary packs all the static files, including the CSS and JavaScript
files, required for the frontend. The `static` directory in root of the
repository is home to all the content packed inside the binary. There is
some preprocessing required for packing the static content into the
binary. This is done using the `make static` command. This essentially
generates a file called `pkg/util/static/resource.go` which contains all
the content in a compressed format.

Once we have our resources ready, we can build the executable using the
`make build` command. We have `VERSION` flag for setting the version of 
the binary. The deafault version is set to `dev`. Hence, the workflow can
be:

```sh
# If there's a change in `static` dir
$ make static
# Building the binary
$ make build VERSION=1.0.1
```

Once the `static` directory is large enough, it's going to take a while to
generate the `resource.go`. For this we have the `DEBUG` flag that can be
set once while building. A binary built in debug mode takes the static
content directly from the file system and is not required to be packaged
inside the executable.

There are other advantages of building binary in debug mode that you'll
learn while working on the project. For now, we can use the following to
speed up our builds:

```sh
# Note that `make static` is not required now.
$ make build DEBUG=on
```

> **Note:** This does pose the constraint that any Pinger command has to
> be executed in the repository's root directory. This shouldn't be an
> issue while developing.

### Protobuf

When making changes to a `.proto` file, we need to compile it into the
equivalent Go code. These generated files (`*.pb.go`) need to be committed.

```sh
$ make proto
```

## Docker Image

`Dockerfile` for the image is present in the root directory. To build the
image, use `make docker` command. This generates an image with tag â€“
`pinger:dev`. To change the tag, we can use the `TAG` option for make
command.

```sh
$ make docker TAG="pinger:v1.2.3"
```

> **Note:** In case of docker image, version is extracted from the tag.
>For example: in the aforementioned case, version of the binary will 
>set to `v1.2.3`.

## Documentation

Documentation is not (yet) packaged into the binary. We currently host it
using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). We use
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) as the documentation
framework. Make sure you have that installed in your `$PATH`.

You can build the documentation using `make docs` command. This generates
the documentation in `docs/book` directory. While developing you might
require to watch the `docs` directory. We can again use the `DEBUG=on`
option in that case.

```sh
# To build the documentation
$ make docs
# Builds the documentation, watches for changes and serves on :3000
$ make docs DEBUG=on
```
