# Pinger

Pinger is an uptime and status monitoring application. It is an open-source
implementation of platforms used to create status pages. Unlike other
alternatives, Pinger can be deployed to create a standalone status page from
a config file as well as a complete platform to manage users, checks, pages,
alerts, etc.

> **Note:** Pinger is currently being developed actively. If you would like
> to contribute to the project, head over to the repository hosted on
