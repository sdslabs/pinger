Pinger is an uptime and status monitoring application. It is an open-source
implementation of platforms used to create status pages. Unlike other
alternatives, Pinger can be deployed to create a standalone status page
from a config file as well as a complete platform to manage users, checks,
pages, alerts, etc.
